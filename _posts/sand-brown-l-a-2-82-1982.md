This is an art by conrad marca relli on Abstract Expressionism. Conrad Marca-Relli (born Corrado Marcarelli; June 5, 1913 Boston â€“ August 29, 2000 Parma) was an American artist who belonged to the early generation of New York School Abstract Expressionist artists whose artistic innovation by the 1950s had been recognized across the Atlantic, including Paris. New York School Abstract Expressionism, represented by Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, Marca-Relli and others became a leading art movement of the postwar era.

Marcarelli (he changed the spelling later in life) was born in Boston and, with his father Cosimo, brother Ettore, and sisters Dora and Ida, moved to New York City when he was 13. In 1930 he studied at the Cooper Union for a year. He later supported himself by working for the Works Progress Administration, first as a teacher and then with mural painting divisions. He served in World War II from 1941 to 1945, after which he became an instructor at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco. In 1947, he moved back to New York and began working in a style fusing Cubism, Surrealism, and Abstract Expressionism. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1951.
